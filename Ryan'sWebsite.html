                <h1>Intro to Ryan</h1>
                <p><strong>Hello, my name is Ryan Landis, and I'm your potential future employee! This website is designed to give you background on me and what I'm all about.
                    I am new to coding and have recently switched careers from stregth coaching where I worked for over 20 years. Although I still love it, I am very excited to be entering the world of tech!</strong></p>

                <h1>Background</h1>
                <strong></small><p>
                    I was born and raised in central Illinois. The town I'm from (Morton, IL) is the pumpkin capitol of the world! I lived there until I went to college at Northern Illinois University where I achieved a B.S. in Exercise Science. I moved to Colorado after finishing college and still live outside of Denver. I am married to my lovely wife of 11 years and have a son Graham (2 years old) and dog Eugere (a 12 year old Frenchie). I have many hobbies which include weightlifting, disc golf, guitar playing and the outdoors (Of course, it's why I moved to CO!) </p>

                <h1>Future Plans</h1>
                <strong></small>I was severely affected by the pandemic (as everyone was!) since I worked in the fitness industry. I started to look for a new career during the lockdown and fell in love with coding. After being encouraged by several of my peers, I decided to make the leap and started practicing HTML, CSS and Javascript. After a few months, I decided that this was the path for me, and enrolled in Coding Temple. What a life changer it was! I am enjoying my course of study and am eager to begin my new career in a challenging role in coding! I look forward to proving myself in my new role and expanding my knowledge base over the next 20 years!</p>
